I built a Deep Learning model (CNN) to solve a genomic classification problem. 
The model processes raw DNA sequences to identify Non-TATA Promoters, which are complex genetic control regions responsible for initiating gene transcription. 
This automates the discovery of gene start sites, a critical step in genome annotation and understanding genetic regulation.
I used Pytorch and Jupyternotebook to achieve my goal and ended up with almost %90 accuracy rate in 10 epochs.
