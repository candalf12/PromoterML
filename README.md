This is a project about Bioinformatics where I used Pytorch and Jupyternotebook to find the sequence called "TATA box" which is an indicator of a promoter region of a DNA sequence.
I used Machine Learning to educate the model and ended up almost with %90 accuracy rate in 10 epochs. I used a library to get the HumanNontataPromoters.
